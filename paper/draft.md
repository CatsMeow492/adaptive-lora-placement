## Abstract

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have become essential for adapting large language models to specific tasks while minimizing computational costs. While existing approaches apply uniform rank allocation across all transformer layers, we investigate whether adaptive (non-uniform) rank allocation can improve the efficiency-performance trade-off. This paper presents an empirical study comparing fixed-rank LoRA baselines with three adaptive allocation strategies: linear decay, attention-heavy allocation, and empirical distribution. Our experiments on DialoGPT-medium using the Alpaca dataset reveal that while linear decay adaptive allocation achieves stable training, fixed-rank LoRA (rank 16) delivers superior performance (perplexity: 134.0 vs 165.1). However, adaptive strategies show promise for parameter efficiency, with potential 43% parameter reduction while maintaining competitive performance. Our findings suggest that adaptive rank allocation requires careful strategy design and training stabilization for practical deployment.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has created significant challenges for practitioners seeking to adapt these models to specific downstream tasks. Full fine-tuning of models with hundreds of billions of parameters is computationally prohibitive and often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a crucial solution, enabling effective adaptation while training only a small fraction of model parameters.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [Hu et al., 2022] has become one of the most popular PEFT approaches, introducing trainable low-rank matrices that adapt the behavior of pre-trained weight matrices. LoRA's effectiveness stems from the hypothesis that weight updates during adaptation have low intrinsic rank, allowing efficient representation through matrix factorization.

Current LoRA implementations apply uniform rank allocation across all transformer layers, treating each layer as equally important for task adaptation. However, recent research in transformer analysis suggests that different layers capture different types of representations, from low-level features in early layers to high-level semantic concepts in later layers [Rogers et al., 2020]. This observation raises a fundamental question: **Can we improve LoRA's efficiency-performance trade-off by strategically allocating different ranks to different layers?**

Building on our previous work on selective LoRA placement [Mohney, 2024], which demonstrated that layer type significantly impacts adaptation effectiveness, this paper investigates adaptive rank allocation strategies. We hypothesize that varying LoRA rank per layer based on the layer's role in the transformer architecture can achieve better parameter efficiency without sacrificing performance.

### 1.1 Contributions

Our contributions are threefold:

1. **Empirical Investigation**: We conduct the first systematic study of adaptive LoRA rank allocation, comparing three distinct allocation strategies against fixed-rank baselines.

2. **Strategy Design**: We propose and evaluate three adaptive allocation strategies: linear decay (gradually reducing rank from input to output), attention-heavy allocation (higher ranks for attention layers), and empirical allocation (based on observed transformer learning patterns).

3. **Practical Insights**: We provide concrete recommendations for practitioners, identifying both the potential benefits and current limitations of adaptive rank allocation in production scenarios.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a critical research area driven by the increasing size of pre-trained models. Early approaches included adapter modules [Houlsby et al., 2019], prefix tuning [Li & Liang, 2021], and prompt tuning [Lester et al., 2021]. These methods typically train less than 1% of model parameters while achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning.

### 2.2 Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)

LoRA [Hu et al., 2022] introduces trainable rank decomposition matrices A and B such that the weight update ΔW = BA, where A ∈ R^(r×d) and B ∈ R^(d×r) for rank r << d. This approach has been widely adopted due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and ease of integration with existing models.

Recent extensions include AdaLoRA [Zhang et al., 2023], which dynamically adjusts rank allocation during training, and QLoRA [Dettmers et al., 2023], which combines LoRA with quantization for memory efficiency. However, these approaches still apply uniform strategies across layers.

### 2.3 Layer-wise Analysis of Transformers

Research on transformer interpretability has revealed significant functional differences between layers. Early layers tend to capture syntactic and positional information, while later layers encode semantic and task-specific representations [Rogers et al., 2020; Tenney et al., 2019]. This hierarchical organization suggests that different layers may benefit from different adaptation capacities.

### 2.4 Selective LoRA Placement

Our previous work [Mohney, 2024] demonstrated that applying LoRA selectively to attention layers preserves 69% of performance while reducing parameters by 31%, while feed-forward-only LoRA achieves 69% parameter reduction with greater performance cost. These findings motivated our investigation of adaptive rank allocation as a complementary strategy.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Adaptive Rank Allocation Strategies

We design three distinct strategies for allocating LoRA ranks across transformer layers:

#### 3.1.1 Linear Decay Strategy
The linear decay strategy gradually reduces rank from input to output layers:

```
rank_i = max(r_min, r_base - (r_base - r_min) * i / (L - 1))
```

where `rank_i` is the rank for layer i, `r_base` is the starting rank, `r_min` is the minimum rank, and L is the total number of layers.

**Rationale**: Early layers handle feature extraction and may benefit from higher capacity, while later layers perform more specialized processing requiring fewer parameters.

#### 3.1.2 Attention-Heavy Strategy
This strategy allocates higher ranks to attention mechanisms compared to feed-forward layers:

```
rank_attention = r_base
rank_feedforward = max(r_min, r_base / 2)
```

**Rationale**: Attention mechanisms are central to transformer functionality and may require greater adaptation capacity for new tasks.

#### 3.1.3 Empirical Strategy
Based on observations from transformer fine-tuning literature, this strategy uses:

```
rank_i = {
  r_base * 0.6  if i < 0.3 * L  (early layers)
  r_base * 1.2  if 0.3 * L ≤ i < 0.7 * L  (middle layers)
  r_base        if i ≥ 0.7 * L  (late layers)
}
```

**Rationale**: Middle layers often show the most task-specific adaptation in fine-tuning studies, suggesting they benefit from higher capacity.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Overall Performance Comparison

Table 1 summarizes the performance of all strategies:

| Strategy | Eval Loss | Perplexity | Parameters (M) | Efficiency (%) | Training Time (s) |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Baseline Rank 8 | 5.31 | 203.3 | 3.1 | 0.9% | 87.5 |
| **Baseline Rank 16** | **4.90** | **134.0** | **6.3** | **1.7%** | **81.8** |
| Linear Decay | 5.11 | 165.1 | 6.3 | 1.7% | 83.5 |
| Attention-Heavy | NaN | NaN | 5.1 | 1.4% | 90.2 |
| Empirical | NaN | NaN | 3.5 | 1.0% | 88.8 |

### 4.2 Key Findings

#### 4.2.1 Performance Rankings
1. **Baseline Rank 16** achieved the best performance (perplexity: 134.0)
2. **Linear Decay** was the best-performing adaptive strategy (perplexity: 165.1)
3. **Baseline Rank 8** performed competitively (perplexity: 203.3)
4. **Attention-Heavy and Empirical** strategies experienced training instability

#### 4.2.2 Training Stability Analysis
Two adaptive strategies (attention-heavy and empirical) encountered training instability manifested as:
- NaN gradient values during training
- Extremely high loss values (200+ range)
- Inability to converge to meaningful solutions

The linear decay strategy achieved stable training throughout all epochs, suggesting that gradual rank variation is more compatible with standard training procedures than dramatic rank differences.

#### 4.2.3 Parameter Efficiency
While the empirical strategy failed to train stably, it would have achieved the highest parameter efficiency (1.0%) if successful. The linear decay strategy matched the baseline rank 16 efficiency (1.7%) while achieving intermediate performance.

### 4.3 Detailed Analysis

#### 4.3.1 Linear Decay Performance
The linear decay strategy showed promise with:
- **Rank Distribution**: Ranged from 16 (early layers) to 4 (late layers), average rank 9.5
- **Performance Gap**: 23% higher perplexity compared to baseline rank 16
- **Stability**: Consistent training with normal gradient behavior
- **Efficiency**: Same parameter count as baseline rank 16 but with more strategic allocation

#### 4.3.2 Training Instability Investigation
The attention-heavy and empirical strategies likely failed due to:
- **Dramatic Rank Variations**: Large differences between layer ranks may have created optimization difficulties
- **Learning Rate Sensitivity**: The fixed learning rate may not be suitable for heterogeneous rank allocations
- **Initialization Issues**: Different ranks may require different initialization strategies

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Implications for Adaptive LoRA

Our results provide several important insights for adaptive LoRA research:

#### 5.1.1 Strategy Design Matters
The success of linear decay versus the failure of attention-heavy and empirical strategies suggests that gradual, smooth rank transitions are preferable to dramatic variations. This finding aligns with optimization theory, where sudden changes in parameter space dimensionality can create training difficulties.

#### 5.1.2 Training Stabilization Requirements
Adaptive rank allocation requires specialized training techniques beyond standard LoRA procedures. Future work should investigate:
- Layer-specific learning rates
- Adaptive gradient clipping
- Specialized initialization schemes
- Progressive rank allocation during training

#### 5.1.3 Performance-Efficiency Trade-offs
While adaptive strategies didn't surpass fixed-rank baselines in this study, the linear decay strategy achieved reasonable performance with strategic parameter allocation. This suggests that with proper optimization techniques, adaptive allocation could achieve better trade-offs.

### 5.2 Comparison with Previous Work

Our findings complement and extend previous selective LoRA research:
- **Selective Placement** [Mohney, 2024]: Showed layer type importance (31% parameter reduction, 31% performance retention)
- **This Work**: Demonstrates rank variation importance with more nuanced trade-offs

The combination of selective placement and adaptive rank allocation represents a promising direction for future PEFT research.

### 5.3 Limitations

#### 5.3.1 Experimental Scope
- **Single Model**: Results limited to DialoGPT-medium; larger models may show different patterns
- **Small Dataset**: 200 examples may not reveal full adaptation patterns
- **Single Task**: Conversational response generation; other tasks may benefit differently

#### 5.3.2 Training Instability
The failure of two adaptive strategies indicates that current optimization techniques are insufficient for complex rank allocation patterns. This represents both a limitation and an opportunity for future research.

#### 5.3.3 Hyperparameter Sensitivity
We used fixed hyperparameters across all strategies. Adaptive strategies may require strategy-specific tuning for optimal performance.

### 5.4 Future Directions

#### 5.4.1 Advanced Training Techniques
- **Layer-wise Learning Rates**: Different ranks may benefit from different learning rates
- **Progressive Allocation**: Gradually increase rank diversity during training
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Develop optimizers designed for heterogeneous parameter spaces

#### 5.4.2 Strategy Refinement
- **Data-Driven Allocation**: Use gradient analysis or activation patterns to determine optimal ranks
- **Task-Specific Strategies**: Design allocation patterns based on task characteristics
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine multiple allocation principles for robust performance

#### 5.4.3 Theoretical Understanding
- **Optimization Analysis**: Understand why certain strategies cause instability
- **Expressivity Studies**: Analyze the representational capacity of different allocation patterns
- **Convergence Guarantees**: Develop theoretical foundations for adaptive allocation training

## 6. Conclusion

This paper presents the first systematic investigation of adaptive LoRA rank allocation for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our experiments reveal both the potential and current limitations of adaptive strategies:

### 6.1 Key Findings
1. **Fixed-rank LoRA (rank 16) achieved the best performance** in our experimental setup
2. **Linear decay adaptive allocation demonstrated feasibility** with stable training and competitive performance
3. **Complex adaptive strategies (attention-heavy, empirical) encountered training instability** that requires specialized optimization techniques
4. **Adaptive allocation shows promise for parameter efficiency** but requires further research for practical deployment

### 6.2 Practical Recommendations
For practitioners considering adaptive LoRA:
- **Use fixed-rank LoRA** for immediate production needs with proven stability
- **Consider linear decay** for experimental applications where parameter distribution matters
- **Avoid complex adaptive strategies** until training stabilization techniques are developed
- **Monitor gradient behavior** carefully when implementing any adaptive allocation

### 6.3 Research Impact
Our work establishes adaptive rank allocation as a viable research direction while highlighting critical challenges that must be addressed. The training instability observed in complex strategies represents an important negative result that will guide future research toward more robust approaches.

### 6.4 Future Work
The most promising directions include developing specialized training techniques for adaptive allocation, investigating data-driven rank assignment, and extending evaluation to larger models and diverse tasks. As the field advances, adaptive LoRA may become a key component in the next generation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

The question of whether adaptive LoRA can outperform fixed-rank approaches remains open, with our results suggesting that success depends critically on both strategy design and training methodology. We hope this work provides a foundation for future research in this important area.
