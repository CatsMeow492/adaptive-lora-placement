# Product Definition: Adaptive LoRA Research

## Problem Statements
1. **Parameter Efficiency Gap**: Current LoRA implementations use fixed ranks across all layers, potentially over-parameterizing some layers while under-parameterizing others
2. **Optimization Opportunity**: Layer-wise capacity allocation could improve efficiency-performance trade-offs
3. **Practitioner Guidance**: Need for systematic strategies to allocate LoRA ranks in real-world deployments
