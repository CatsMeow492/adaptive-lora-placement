# Decision Log: Adaptive LoRA Research

## Decision Records

### Decision 1: Memory Bank Architecture
**Date**: Project Initialization
**Context**: Need for systematic project context management across sessions
**Options Considered**:
1. Simple documentation files
2. External project management tools
3. Structured memory bank system
4. No formal documentation

**Rationale**: Given the complexity of ML research and need for continuity across sessions, a structured memory bank provides comprehensive context management while remaining self-contained within the project.

**Impact Assessment**: 
- **Positive**: Excellent context retention, systematic organization, agent-friendly structure
- **Negative**: Initial setup overhead, maintenance requirements
- **Trade-offs**: Time investment upfront for long-term efficiency gains

**Validation**: Success measured by ability to maintain context across sessions and systematic progress tracking.

### Decision 2: Model Selection - DialoGPT-medium
**Date**: Project Initialization
**Context**: Need to select base model for LoRA experiments
**Options Considered**:
1. GPT-2 (small, fast training)
2. DialoGPT-medium (361M, balanced)
3. DialoGPT-large (774M, more comprehensive)
4. Other transformer models

**Rationale**: DialoGPT-medium provides optimal balance between model complexity and computational requirements while maintaining comparability with previous "Selective LoRA" work.

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Positive**: Manageable training time, sufficient complexity, established baseline
- **Negative**: Limited to one model family, may not generalize
- **Trade-offs**: Specificity vs. generalizability

**Validation**: Training times under 2 hours per experiment, meaningful performance differences between strategies.

### Decision 3: Dataset Choice - Alpaca Subset
**Date**: Project Initialization
**Context**: Need representative dataset for fine-tuning experiments
**Options Considered**:
1. Full Alpaca dataset (52K examples)
2. Alpaca subset (100-200 examples)
3. Dolly dataset
4. Custom dataset creation

**Rationale**: Alpaca subset provides sufficient diversity for meaningful comparisons while keeping training times manageable and maintaining consistency with research plan.

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Positive**: Faster experimentation, manageable scope, established quality
- **Negative**: Limited statistical power, potential overfitting
- **Trade-offs**: Speed vs. statistical robustness

**Validation**: Consistent performance differences across strategies, adequate sample size for conclusions.

### Decision 4: Technology Stack - PyTorch + Hugging Face
**Date**: Project Initialization
**Context**: Need to select core ML framework and libraries
**Options Considered**:
1. PyTorch + Transformers + PEFT
2. TensorFlow + custom LoRA
3. JAX + Flax
4. Framework-agnostic approach

**Rationale**: PyTorch ecosystem provides mature, well-documented LoRA implementations through PEFT library, reducing implementation complexity and potential bugs.

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Positive**: Proven implementations, extensive documentation, community support
- **Negative**: Dependency on external libraries, potential version conflicts
- **Trade-offs**: Implementation speed vs. custom control

**Validation**: Successful reproduction of baseline results, stable training across experiments.

### Decision 5: Experimental Design - Fixed Baselines First
**Date**: Project Initialization
**Context**: Need to establish experimental methodology
**Options Considered**:
1. Baselines and adaptive strategies simultaneously
2. Fixed-rank baselines first, then adaptive
3. Adaptive strategies only
4. Literature comparison only

**Rationale**: Establishing solid fixed-rank baselines provides necessary reference points for evaluating adaptive strategies and ensures fair comparison methodology.

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Positive**: Clear comparison baseline, systematic methodology, reduces confounding variables
- **Negative**: Sequential rather than parallel development, longer overall timeline
- **Trade-offs**: Rigor vs. speed

**Validation**: Baseline results match expected performance ranges, provide clear reference for adaptive strategies.

### Decision 6: Rank Selection - 8 and 16 for Baselines
**Date**: Project Initialization
**Context**: Need to select fixed ranks for baseline comparison
**Options Considered**:
1. Single rank (8 or 16)
2. Multiple ranks (4, 8, 16, 32)
3. Ranks 8 and 16 only
4. Power-of-2 series

**Rationale**: Ranks 8 and 16 provide good coverage of typical LoRA usage while maintaining manageable experiment count and covering both low and medium rank scenarios.

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Positive**: Comprehensive coverage, manageable experiment count, standard choices
- **Negative**: Limited resolution, may miss optimal fixed rank
- **Trade-offs**: Completeness vs. efficiency

**Validation**: Clear performance differences between ranks, representative of typical usage patterns.

### Decision 7: Adaptive Strategy Focus
**Date**: Project Initialization
**Context**: Need to prioritize which adaptive strategies to implement
**Options Considered**:
1. Linear decay (simple mathematical)
2. Attention-heavy (layer-type based)
3. Empirical allocation (data-driven)
4. All simultaneously

**Rationale**: Start with linear decay as simplest approach, then attention-heavy based on prior work insights, finally empirical for data-driven optimization.

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Positive**: Progressive complexity, builds on prior insights, covers different approaches
- **Negative**: Sequential implementation, may miss complex interactions
- **Trade-offs**: Systematic approach vs. comprehensive coverage

**Validation**: Each strategy shows distinct performance characteristics, clear differentiation in results.

## Decision Impact Summary
- **Architecture**: Strong foundation for systematic research
- **Technology**: Rapid development with proven tools
- **Experimental Design**: Rigorous methodology with clear baselines
- **Scope**: Manageable while maintaining research depth

## Future Decision Points
1. **Statistical Testing**: How to assess significance of performance differences
2. **Strategy Extensions**: Which additional adaptive strategies to explore
3. **Paper Structure**: How to organize results for maximum impact
4. **Reproducibility**: Level of detail needed for full reproduction
