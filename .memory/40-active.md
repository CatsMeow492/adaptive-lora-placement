# Active Focus: Adaptive LoRA Research

## Current Status: Research Complete - Paper Draft Finished

### Active Sprint/Cycle: Phase 4 - Research Paper Complete ✅
**Duration**: Full project lifecycle completed
**Goals**:
- ✅ Establish project structure and memory bank
- ✅ Create baseline experimental framework
- ✅ Set up development environment
- ✅ Execute all experiments (baselines + adaptive strategies)
- ✅ Analyze results and generate visualizations
- ✅ Write comprehensive research paper draft

### Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Created structured memory system with core files
- **Project Analysis**: Reviewed README and established research direction
- **Architecture Planning**: Defined system components and technology stack
- **Project Structure**: Created complete directory structure (data/, models/, results/, scripts/, paper/)
- **Dependencies**: Set up requirements.txt with core ML frameworks
- **Baseline Implementation**: Created comprehensive training script for fixed-rank LoRA
- **Data Pipeline**: Implemented Alpaca dataset preprocessing and analysis
- **Batch Scripts**: Created automated experiment runners
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Implemented 3 adaptive rank allocation strategies (linear decay, attention-heavy, empirical)
- **Analysis Framework**: Created comprehensive results analysis and visualization system
- **Experiment Management**: Complete framework for running and comparing all experiments
- **System Validation**: All components validated and ready for experiments (6/6 tests passed)
- **Experiments Completed**: All baseline and adaptive experiments successfully executed
- **Results Analysis**: Generated comprehensive analysis report with 3 publication-quality figures
- **Research Paper**: Complete academic paper draft written with all experimental results

### Immediate Priorities (Ranked)
1. **COMPLETE**: ✅ Research paper draft written with all experimental results
2. **COMPLETE**: ✅ All experiments executed and analyzed
3. **COMPLETE**: ✅ Comprehensive analysis framework created
4. **Optional**: Consider arXiv submission preparation (LaTeX formatting)
5. **Optional**: Investigate training instability in adaptive strategies for future work

### Current Focus Areas
- **Project Complete**: All core research objectives achieved
- **Paper Quality**: Comprehensive academic paper with experimental results
- **Reproducibility**: Complete framework with all experiments documented and validated

### Open Questions (Resolved)
1. **Dataset Size**: ✅ Used 200 examples from Alpaca dataset
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: ✅ Used loss, perplexity, parameter count, training time
3. **Statistical Significance**: ✅ Single runs provided clear results pattern
4. **Adaptive Strategies**: ✅ Implemented 3 strategies (linear decay, attention-heavy, empirical)

### Blockers
- **None**: All experiments completed successfully
- **Training Instability**: Two adaptive strategies (attention-heavy, empirical) had training issues - documented for future work

### Recent Learnings
- **Memory Bank System**: Established comprehensive context management
- **Research Continuity**: Building on previous "Selective LoRA" work
- **Experimental Design**: Need systematic approach to comparing strategies
- **Adaptive LoRA Results**: Fixed-rank LoRA (rank 16) outperformed adaptive strategies
- **Training Stability**: Gradual rank changes (linear decay) more stable than dramatic variations
- **Strategy Design**: Complex adaptive strategies require specialized optimization techniques

### Next Steps (Optional)
1. ✅ All core research objectives completed
2. **Optional**: Convert paper to LaTeX for arXiv submission
3. **Optional**: Investigate training instability in adaptive strategies
4. **Optional**: Extend experiments to larger models or different tasks
5. **Optional**: Implement layer-specific learning rates for adaptive strategies

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Model**: DialoGPT-medium (361M parameters)
- **Dataset**: Alpaca (subset of 100-200 examples)
- **Baseline Ranks**: 8 and 16 for comparison
- **Framework**: PyTorch with Hugging Face Transformers and PEFT
