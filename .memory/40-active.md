# Active Focus: Adaptive LoRA Research

## Current Status: Foundation Complete - Ready for Experiments

### Active Sprint/Cycle: Phase 1 - Foundation Setup (Nearly Complete)
**Duration**: Initial setup phase
**Goals**:
- ✅ Establish project structure and memory bank
- ✅ Create baseline experimental framework
- ✅ Set up development environment

### Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Created structured memory system with core files
- **Project Analysis**: Reviewed README and established research direction
- **Architecture Planning**: Defined system components and technology stack
- **Project Structure**: Created complete directory structure (data/, models/, results/, scripts/, paper/)
- **Dependencies**: Set up requirements.txt with core ML frameworks
- **Baseline Implementation**: Created comprehensive training script for fixed-rank LoRA
- **Data Pipeline**: Implemented Alpaca dataset preprocessing and analysis
- **Batch Scripts**: Created automated experiment runners
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Implemented 3 adaptive rank allocation strategies (linear decay, attention-heavy, empirical)
- **Analysis Framework**: Created comprehensive results analysis and visualization system
- **Experiment Management**: Complete framework for running and comparing all experiments
- **System Validation**: All components validated and ready for experiments (6/6 tests passed)

### Immediate Priorities (Ranked)
1. **High Priority**: Execute all experiments (baseline + adaptive)
2. **High Priority**: Generate comprehensive analysis and figures
3. **Medium Priority**: Write paper draft based on results
4. **Medium Priority**: Create publication-ready visualizations
5. **Low Priority**: Prepare for arXiv submission

### Current Focus Areas
- **Project Structure**: Following suggested directory layout from README
- **Baseline Implementation**: Need to create fixed-rank LoRA experiments first
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring experiments can be consistently reproduced

### Open Questions
1. **Dataset Size**: Should we use full Alpaca dataset or specific subset size?
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: What additional metrics beyond loss and perplexity?
3. **Statistical Significance**: How many runs per experiment for valid comparisons?
4. **Adaptive Strategies**: Which specific rank allocation strategies to implement first?

### Blockers
- **None Currently**: Project is in initial setup phase
- **Potential**: Need to verify GPU availability for training experiments

### Recent Learnings
- **Memory Bank System**: Established comprehensive context management
- **Research Continuity**: Building on previous "Selective LoRA" work
- **Experimental Design**: Need systematic approach to comparing strategies

### Next Steps
1. Create directory structure matching README suggestions
2. Set up Python environment and dependencies
3. Implement baseline training script for DialoGPT-medium
4. Create data preprocessing for Alpaca dataset
5. Design first adaptive rank allocation strategy

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Model**: DialoGPT-medium (361M parameters)
- **Dataset**: Alpaca (subset of 100-200 examples)
- **Baseline Ranks**: 8 and 16 for comparison
- **Framework**: PyTorch with Hugging Face Transformers and PEFT
