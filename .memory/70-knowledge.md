# Knowledge Base: Adaptive LoRA Research

## Domain Concepts

### LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
**Definition**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that adds trainable low-rank matrices to pretrained model weights while keeping original weights frozen.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- For weight matrix W, LoRA adds ΔW = BA where B ∈ R^(d×r) and A ∈ R^(r×k)
- Rank r << min(d,k), typically r ∈ {4, 8, 16, 32}
- Final computation: h = W₀x + ΔWx = W₀x + BAx

**Key Properties**:
- Dramatically reduces trainable parameters (often 0.1-1% of original)
- Maintains performance on many tasks
- Enables efficient deployment and switching between adaptations

### Adaptive Rank Allocation
**Definition**: Varying LoRA rank per layer rather than using fixed rank across all layers.

**Motivation**: Different layers may require different capacity for adaptation:
- Early layers: Low-level features, may need less adaptation
- Middle layers: Task-specific representations, may need more adaptation
- Late layers: Task-specific outputs, adaptation needs vary by task

**Strategies**:
1. **Linear Decay**: Rank decreases/increases linearly with layer depth
2. **Attention-Heavy**: Higher ranks for attention layers, lower for feed-forward
3. **Empirical**: Data-driven allocation based on layer importance metrics

### Parameter Efficiency
**Definition**: Achieving comparable performance with fewer trainable parameters.

**Metrics**:
- **Parameter Count**: Total trainable parameters
- **Parameter Reduction**: Percentage reduction vs. full fine-tuning
- **Efficiency Ratio**: Performance maintained per parameter added

**Trade-offs**:
- Performance vs. parameter count
- Training time vs. adaptation quality
- Memory usage vs. model capacity

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why DialoGPT-medium instead of larger models?
**A**: Balances model complexity with computational feasibility while maintaining meaningful experimental results. Larger models would require more computational resources without necessarily providing better insights for the rank allocation question.

### Q: How many examples needed for statistical significance?
**A**: With 100-200 Alpaca examples and multiple random seeds, we can achieve reasonable statistical power for detecting meaningful performance differences between strategies.

### Q: What constitutes "meaningful" performance improvement?
**A**: Given the goal of efficiency, we look for strategies that either:
1. Maintain performance with fewer parameters
2. Improve performance with same parameter count
3. Provide better efficiency-performance trade-off curve

### Q: How to handle potential overfitting with small dataset?
**A**: Use cross-validation, monitor training/validation curves, and focus on consistent trends across multiple runs rather than absolute performance numbers.

### Q: What if adaptive strategies don't outperform fixed ranks?
**A**: Negative results are valuable! Would provide insights into when uniform allocation is sufficient and guide future research directions.

## Implicit Knowledge

### Training Dynamics
- LoRA training typically converges faster than full fine-tuning
- Early layers often need less adaptation than later layers
- Attention mechanisms often benefit more from adaptation than feed-forward layers

### Implementation Details
- PEFT library handles most LoRA implementation complexity
- Gradient checkpointing can reduce memory usage for larger models
- Learning rate scheduling often important for stable LoRA training

### Evaluation Considerations
- Perplexity correlates well with downstream task performance
